## Try devMode.fm Yourself!

### Initial setup

You'll need [Docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) for your platform installed to run devMode in local development

* Clone the git repo with `git clone https://github.com/nystudio107/devmode.git`
* In your terminal, type `cd devmode` then `cp cms/example.env cms/.env` to set up the `.env` file
* Start up the site with `docker-compose up` (the first build will be somewhat lengthy)
* Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to use the site

The `webpack-dev-server` for Hot Module Replacement (HMR) serving of static resources runs off of `http://localhost:8080`

ðŸŽ‰ You're now up and running Nginx, PHP, Postgres, Redis, xdebug, & ffmpeg without having to do any devops!

The first time you do `docker-compose up` it will be slow, because it has to build all of the Docker images.

Subsequent `docker-compose up` commands will be much faster, but still a little slow because we intentionally do a `composer install` and an `npm install` each time, to keep our dependencies in sync.

Wait until you see the following to indicate that the PHP container is ready:

```
php_1         | Craft is installed.
php_1         | Applying changes from your project config files ... done
php_1         | [01-Dec-2020 18:38:46] NOTICE: fpm is running, pid 22
php_1         | [01-Dec-2020 18:38:46] NOTICE: ready to handle connections
```

...and the following to indicate that the webpack container is ready:
```
webpack_1     | <i> devmode-fm (webpack 5.9.0) compiled successfully in 12097 ms
webpack_1     | <i> [webpack-dev-middleware] Child "devmode-fm": Compiled successfully.
```

All of the Twig files, JavaScript, Vue components, CSS, and even the webpack config itself will relfect changes immediately Hot Module Replacement and `webpack-dev-server`, so feel free to edit things and play around.

A password-scrubbed seed database will automatically be installed; you can log into the CP at `http://localhost:8000/admin` via these credentials:

**User:** `andrew@nystudio107.com` \
**Password:** `password`

### Things you can try

With the containers up and running, here are a few things you can try:

* Edit a CSS file such as `src/css/components/global.pcss` to add something like this, and change the colors to see the CSS change instantly via HRM:
```css
* {
  border: 3px solid red;
}
```

* Edit the `src/vue/DevmodePlayer.vue` vue component, changing the `currentSeconds` [data prop](https://github.com/nystudio107/devmode/blob/master/src/vue/DevmodePlayer.vue#L135) and see your changes instantly via HMR

* Set up the `.env.sh` file in the `scripts/` directory if you want to use the scripts there by running this in your terminal from the project root: `cp scripts/example.env.sh scripts/.env.sh`
  
* Build the production assets by typing `cd scripts` and then typing `./docker_prod_build.sh` to build the critical CSS, fonts, and other production assets. They will appear in `cms/web/dist/` (just double-click on the `report-legacy.html` and `report-modern.html` files to view them)

 **N.B.:** Without authorization & credentials (which are private), the `scripts/docker_pull_db.sh` will not work. It's provided here for instructional purposes, and for devMode.fm hosts

### Other notes

To update to the latest Composer packages (as constrained by the `cms/composer.json` semvers), do:
```
rm cms/composer.lock
docker-compose up
```

To update to the latest npm packages (as constrained by the `docker-config/webpack-dev-devmode/package.json` semvers), do:
```
rm docker-config/webpack-dev-devmode/package-lock.json
docker-compose up
```

To use Xdebug with VSCode install the [PHP Debug extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=felixfbecker.php-debug ) and use the following configuration:
```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Listen for Xdebug",
            "type": "php",
            "request": "launch",
            "port": 9003,
            "log": true,
            "externalConsole": false,
            "pathMappings": {
                "/var/www/project/cms": "${workspaceRoot}/cms"
            },
            "ignore": ["**/vendor/**/*.php"]
        }
    ]
}
```

## Deployment

[buddy.works](https://buddy.works/) is used for atomic deployments where the webpack build and `composer install` are done in buddy.works Docker containers. The the results are then deployed to the Forge-provisioned VPS vis [rsync](https://buddy.works/docs/deployments/rsync).

Forge Daemon Queue Runner: 

```
/usr/bin/nice -n 10 /usr/bin/php /home/forge/devmode.fm/current/craft queue/listen --verbose
```

## About Craft CMS

Craft is a content-first CMS that aims to make life enjoyable for developers and content managers alike. It is optimized for bespoke web and application development, offering developers a clean slate to build out exactly what they want, rather than wrestling with a theme.

Learn more about Craft at [craftcms.com](https://craftcms.com).

## Roadmap

* Move to containerized builds in buddy.works & atomic deployments
